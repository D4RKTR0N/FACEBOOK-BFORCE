Protect yourself from this attack:

    Use Strong Password which contains {letters(lower,upper),tokens,numbers} make it longest as possible, at least 10 letters
    don't use your basic information in the password for example don't use your name or birthday
    because the hacker can do a information gathering attack and get this information easily
    then he will generate a wordlist based on this info.
    Use 2F Authentication.
